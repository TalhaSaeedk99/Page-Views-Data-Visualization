# Page-Views-Data-Visualization
Visualization of time series data in the form of a line chart, bar chart, and box plots are made using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python. Dataset contains the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations help in understanding the patterns in visits.
